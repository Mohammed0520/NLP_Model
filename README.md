This is a Python code for a Flask web application that performs sentiment analysis on a given dataset of customer comments. The application uses the Twitter RoBERTa model for sentiment analysis.

The code defines several functions for preprocessing the text of the comments, performing sentiment analysis on individual comments, and aggregating the results into a Pandas dataframe.

The Flask web application is defined using the Flask module and defines a single route /nlp_model that accepts a POST request containing a URL to a CSV file of customer comments. The function preprocesses the data, performs sentiment analysis, and returns the results as a JSON object.

This code can be used as a starting point for building a sentiment analysis web application that can be deployed on a server or cloud platform. Developers can modify the code to customize the preprocessing steps, use a different sentiment analysis model, or add additional features to the web application. The code can also be extended to handle larger datasets and provide more advanced analytics and visualizations of the sentiment analysis results.
